- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @AmanuelAbay
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Coding
  
üå± Welcome to my github account! With a passion for coding and a background in Software Engineering, I specialize in backend development with a focus on providing efficient and optimized solutions for any coding tasks. I graduated from Addis Ababa Science and Technology University with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. With four years of coding experience, including one year dedicated to backend development, I have honed my skills and expertise in various technologies and frameworks.

In the realm of backend development, I excel in working with technologies such as Hasura, Golang, Docker, AWS, Digital Ocean, and Express, which is a powerful Node.js framework. I have hands-on experience in integrating backend solutions with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, ensuring seamless data management and retrieval.

Furthermore, I have expertise in working with Nats, a distributed systems technology for backend APIs. Nats enables me to build scalable and resilient systems that can handle high volumes of data and traffic, ensuring reliable communication across distributed components.

One of my key strengths lies in my ability to provide efficient and optimized solutions for coding tasks. I have a meticulous approach to problem-solving and a keen eye for identifying performance bottlenecks. Through careful analysis and thoughtful implementation, I strive to deliver solutions that not only meet functional requirements but also perform exceptionally well in real-world scenarios.

Additionally, I am well-versed in frontend development tools and frameworks such as React, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt.js, and popular UI libraries like MaterialUI, Tailwind CSS, Vuetify, and Bootstrap. I believe in crafting engaging and user-friendly interfaces that enhance the overall user experience.

In my journey as a software engineer, I have also ventured into desktop application development using Java and FXML for the frontend, while employing Hibernate and Spring frameworks for the backend, leveraging the power of MySQL databases.

With each project, I strive for excellence and focus on delivering high-quality solutions that meet client requirements. My goal is to contribute to innovative and impactful software solutions that make a difference in the lives of users.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my projects and experiences to get a deeper insight into my skills and capabilities as a backend software engineer. I look forward to connecting and collaborating on exciting projects in the future.
